# CS.13.02-Lab.2.3

Your task is to create a class called <b>Number</b> that will store a <b>denary</b> value and be able to return the <b>binary (signed)</b> and <b>hexadecimal</b> equivalent. 

The implementation of any methods in the Number class should not use the Integer class or any other inbuilt methods such as those found in the Integer class.  

Your solution must pass all of the tests in the <b>NumberTest</b> class (provided).

Good luck, have fun =)
